### 🛍️ **Project Title**: *Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews*

---

### 📌 **Objective**:

To classify product reviews (from Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using a **Decision Tree** classifier.

---

## 🧠 **Step-by-Step Workflow (Without Code)**

---

### ✅ **1. Define the Problem**

You want to automatically determine whether a product review is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

---

### ✅ **2. Collect Data**

Get a dataset containing:

* Customer review text
* Sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral)

🟢 Example sources:

* [Amazon Product Review Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* Flipkart review data (can be scraped or collected from public APIs)

---

### ✅ **3. Preprocess the Text Data**

Clean the raw text for better analysis:

* Remove punctuation, numbers, and symbols
* Convert to lowercase
* Remove stopwords (e.g., "is", "the", "a")
* Perform stemming or lemmatization (reduce words to base form)

---

### ✅ **4. Feature Extraction**

Transform cleaned text into numerical form:

* Use **CountVectorizer** or **TF-IDF** to create a matrix of word frequencies.

---

### ✅ **5. Split the Data**

Divide the dataset into:

* **Training Set** – Used to train the model (e.g., 80%)
* **Testing Set** – Used to evaluate performance (e.g., 20%)

---

### ✅ **6. Train the Model**

Use the training data to train a **Decision Tree classifier**:

* The tree learns patterns in word usage associated with each sentiment label.

---

### ✅ **7. Test and Evaluate the Model**

Use the test data to:

* Predict the sentiment
* Measure performance using:

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision/Recall**
  * **Confusion Matrix**

---

### ✅ **8. Visualize the Tree** *(Optional)*

* Plot the decision tree to understand how it classifies the reviews.

---

### ✅ **9. Improve (Optional)**

Enhance performance by:

* Pruning the tree
* Adjusting max depth
* Trying ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

---

### ✅ **10. Deployment (Optional)**

Build a simple **web app**:

* User enters a product review
* Model outputs: **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**
